# ‚öíÔ∏è Hands-on Lab: Deploying CRUD App on AWS using EC2, RDS, and ALB

<a id="readme-top"></a>

## Overview

### üìå What are we trying to achive?

We are familiar with the demand on modern web application, even if its incoming/outgoing traffic **increase or decrease dramatically**, our application should **stay online without crashing**. To achieve this, we can **spread the workload across multiple servers** and use AWS managed services to keep things running smoothly.

### üìö What are we going to learn? </br>

In this workshop, you will be able to deploy a [web application](https://github.com/jcmsj/ust-workshop.git) on AWS and keep it highly available. Don't worry, we will guide you along the way!

- Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for distributing traffic
- Provision **Two EC2 instances** running the same backend application
- Setup **Amazon RDS** as the database backend
- Utilize **Security Group and IAM roles** to keep everything secure and safe.

### ‚ùì Basically, how does the project work as a whole?

1. A user visits the app from their web browser.
2. The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** will decide where the traffic will go (in which EC2 instance).
3. The **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances** you setup will process the request.
4. If the app needs to save or retrieve data, it will talk to the **Amazon RDS database**.

## Prerequisites

### üíª Environment Setup

To access the AWS console, use the credentials provided to you and follow the steps below:<br />

1. Access the AWS Console using the provided link (or if unavailable, [click here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/)). Use the login credentials (Account ID/alias, username, password) provided and click the <strong>"Sign In"</strong> button.

> Soft reminder: <strong>Please be mindful of your costs. üí∞</strong> Rest assured that you have just the sufficient access to services. But, make sure to turn off unused resources and clean up if you are exploring.

### Step 5 - Start accessing your app!

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a web application using AWS. Along the way, you worked with these key services:

‚úÖ EC2 ‚Äì For hosting your application
‚úÖ RDS ‚Äì For managing your database
‚úÖ ALB ‚Äì For handling traffic efficiently

Great job! Keep exploring and experimenting with AWS to deepen your skills. üöÄ

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### 1. ALB Not Routing Traffic

- Ensure EC2 **Security Group allows ALB inbound traffic** on port **5000**.
- Verify **Target Group health checks** are passing.

### 2. RDS Connection Errors

- Ensure RDS **Public Access** is enabled (for testing).
- Check **Security Group** allows **EC2 IP access on port 3306/5432**.
- Use:
  ```sh
  telnet your-rds-endpoint 3306
  ```
  to test connectivity.
